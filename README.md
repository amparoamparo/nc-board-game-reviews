## About the project

![Screenshot - Desktop](public/assets/screenshot.png)

NC Board Game Reviews is a community-driven platform for board game lovers, where they come together to review board games and interact with each other.

I built this responsive website as part of an immersive full-stack coding bootcamp. I also built the API it uses from scratch, [check it out here](https://github.com/amparoamparo/nc-board-game-reviews-api).

*Note: there was no design provided, I loosely designed it on Figma myself before starting to style the website.*
